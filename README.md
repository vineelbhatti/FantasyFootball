# FantasyFootball

This is a fantasy football prediction system I built as a high school junior using machine learning. I started by exploring a fantasy football dataset I found on Kaggle to practice working with Pandas dataframes and graphing libraries. As I progressed, I wanted to go beyond simple analysis and use machine learning to make predictions.

At the time, I was completely new to ML, so I began experimenting with guidance from ChatGPT and YouTube videos. I first used a Random Forest model, which gave decent results, but I wanted to improve accuracy. But in order to improve my code, I had to understand how it worked, so I went back to YouTube and learned how decision trees, SVMs, and other ML algorithms worked. In the end, I implemented a Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM model, and found the XGBoost to be the most accurate for my dataset.

Iâ€™m proud of this project because it required extensive self-learning, especially tackling complex topics as a high school junior with no calculus knowledge. Through curiosity and persistence, I developed a functional ML system while self-learning the basics of how ML algorithms work.
